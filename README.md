Application to test my ability to re-create a twitter in a week

Hi!

So I am creating this repo to store my code to run my twitter application. A couple of requirements that it must meet:
  - 2 REST endpoints
      - LOGIN (GET) - technically a post since the use will enter their login creds and be redirected to their feed once once authenticated
      - POST (POST) - when the user wasnts to tweet something, they will hit this endpoint to add to the feed  
  - User Feed
      - Create tweet
      - Tweets (refresh essentially)
      - My Tweets (personal page)
      - Logout
  - User personal page
